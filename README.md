This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving mutable variables in a recursive F# function. The bug showcases how unexpected behavior can arise when modifying mutable state within recursive calls. The solution provides a corrected version and explains the underlying cause of the error.  The bug highlights the importance of carefully managing mutable state in functional programming to avoid unintended side effects and maintain program correctness.
